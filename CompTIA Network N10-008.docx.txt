·        The communication between these processes can be seen as a method of co-operation between them.
·        Processes can communicate with each other through both: Shared Memory. Message passing.
	SYSLOG – 514
	·        Syslog, is a standardized way (or Protocol) of producing and sending Log and Event information from Unix/Linux and Windows systems (which produces Event Logs) and Devices (Routers, Firewalls, Switches, Servers, etc) over UDP Port 514 to a centralized Log/Event Message collector which is known as a Syslog Server
	SMTP TLS - 587
	·        Port 587: This is the default mail submission port.
·        When users submit an email to be routed by a proper mail server, this is the one that will provide best results.
·        Port 587, coupled with TLS encryption, ensures that email is submitted securely and following the guidelines set out by the IETF.
·        SMTPS is a method for securing the SMTP using transport layer security.
·        It is intended to provide authentication of the communication partners, as well as data integrity and confidentiality.
·        SMTPS is not a proprietary protocol and not an extension of SMTP.
	LDAPS – LDAP OVER SSL - 636
	·        LDAPS (LDAP over SSL) and STARTTLS (LDAP over TLS) are both secure versions of LDAP that encrypt the authentication process.
·        (Note that “LDAPS” is often used to denote LDAP over SSL, STARTTLS, and a Secure LDAP implementation).
	IMAPS - IMAP OVER SSL - 993
	·        IMAPS (IMAP over SSL) means that IMAP traffic travels over a secure socket to a secure port, typically TCP port 993.
·        Assuming that an SSL certificate is in place, there should not be anything further that needs to be enabled on the server.
	POPS – POP 3 OVER SSL – 995
	·        The POP3S protocol uses port 995 and encrypts the connection between the email client and mail server.
·        Email clients usually don't use the name POP3S, but if you use port 995 then your login credentials are transmitted securely.
·        Similarly, IMAP uses port 143 and doesn't support SSL/TLS.
	SQL SERVER – STRUCTURED QUERY LANGUAGE - 1433
	·        Structured Query Language (SQL) is a standardized programming language that is used to manage relational databases and perform various operations on the data in them.
	SQLNET - 1521
	·        SQL*Net is Oracle's remote data access protocol that enables client-server and server-server communications across networks.
·        An Oracle client connects to the server using the port address of the listener
·        which is normally defined as TCP port 1521 during Oracle installation.
·        In database computing, sqlnet.ora is a plain-text configuration file that contains the information on how both Oracle server and Oracle client have to use Oracle Net capabilities for networked database access.
	MYSQL – 3306
	·        Port 3306 is the default port for the classic MySQL protocol (port)
·        which is used by the mysql client, MySQL Connectors, and utilities such as mysqldump and mysqlpump.
·        MySQL is an open-source relational database management system.
·        Its name is a combination of "My", the name of co-founder Michael Widenius's daughter, and "SQL", the abbreviation for Structured Query Language.
·                                    
	RDP – REMOTE DESKTOP PROTOCOL - 3389
	·        Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) is a Microsoft proprietary protocol that enables remote connections to other computers
·        Typically over TCP port 3389. It provides network access for a remote user over an encrypted channel.
·        Remote Desktop Protocol is a proprietary protocol developed by Microsoft which provides a user with a graphical interface to connect to another computer over a network connection.
·        The user employs RDP client software for this purpose, while the other computer must run RDP server software.
	SIP – SESSION INTIATION PROTOCOL – 5060/5061
	·        SIP clients typically use TCP or UDP on port numbers 5060 or 5061 for SIP traffic to servers and other endpoints.
·        Port 5060 is commonly used for non-encrypted signaling traffic whereas port 5061 is typically used for traffic encrypted with Transport Layer Security (TLS).
·        3CX, Bria, and SIPDroid are three of the most popular SIP clients
·        They are recommended by many of the business VoIP providers that we review.
·        A SIP client can be a desktop client or a mobile phone client, although most developers release both desktop and mobile clients.
	IP PROTOCOL TYPES
	·         
	ICMP – INTERNET CONTROL MESSAGE PROTOCOL
	·        The Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) is a protocol
·        that devices within a network use to communicate problems with data transmission.
·        In this ICMP definition, one of the primary ways in which ICMP is used is to determine if data is getting to its destination and at the right time.
·        The Internet Control Message Protocol is a supporting protocol in the Internet protocol suite.
·        It is used by network devices, including routers, to send error messages and operational information
·        Example - ping 1.1.1.1
	TCP – TRANSMISSION CONTROL PROTOCOL
	·        The Transmission Control Protocol is one of the main protocols of the Internet protocol suite.
·        It originated in the initial network implementation in which it complemented the Internet Protocol.
·        Therefore, the entire suite is commonly referred to as TCP/IP.
·        Hence TCP is used in Text Communication due to its reliable transmission, error control, and in order receiving of the data.
·        Example: Whatsapp, Instagram, Google Chat,iMessage. TCP is used in File transfer when we cannot tolerate the loss of data and receiving the data incorrect order is of utmost importance.
	UDP – USER DATAGRAM PROTOCOL
	·        the User Datagram Protocol is one of the core members of the Internet protocol suite.
·        With UDP, computer applications can send messages, in this case referred to as datagrams, to other hosts on an Internet Protocol network.
·        UDP applications do not employ reliability mechanisms and may even be hindered by them.
·        Streaming media, real-time multiplayer games and voice over IP (VoIP) are examples of applications that often use UDP.
·        In these particular applications, loss of packets is not usually a fatal problem.
	GRE – GENERIC ROUTING ENCAPSULATION
	·        Generic routing encapsulation (GRE) provides a private path for transporting packets through an otherwise public network by encapsulating (or tunneling) the packets.
·        GRE tunneling is accomplished through tunnel endpoints that encapsulate or de-encapsulate traffic.
·        Generic Routing Encapsulation is a tunneling protocol developed by Cisco Systems
·        It can encapsulate a wide variety of network layer protocols inside virtual point-to-point links or point-to-multipoint links over an Internet Protocol network.
·        For example, GRE tunnels allow routing protocols such as RIP and OSPF to forward data packets from one switch to another switch across the Internet.
·        In addition, GRE tunnels can encapsulate multicast data streams for transmission over the Internet.
·        GRE is described in RFC 2784 (obsoletes earlier RFCs 1701 and 1702).
	IPSEC – INTERNET PROTOCOL SECURITY
	·        Internet Protocol Security is a secure network protocol suite that authenticates and encrypts the packets of data to provide secure encrypted communication between two computers over an Internet Protocol network.
·        It is used in virtual private networks.
·        IPsec is used for protecting sensitive data, such as financial transactions, medical records and corporate communications, as it's transmitted across the network.
·        It's also used to secure virtual private networks (VPNs), where IPsec tunneling encrypts all data sent between two endpoints.
	AH – AUTHENTICATION HEADER
	·        The Authentication Header (AH) protocol provides data origin authentication, data integrity, and replay protection.
·        However, AH does not provide data confidentiality, which means that all of your data is sent in the clear.
·        It is a simple authentication scheme built into the HTTP protocol.
·        The client sends HTTP requests with the Authorization header that contains the word Basic, followed by a space and a base64-encoded(non-encrypted) string username: password. For example, to authorize as username / Pa$$w0rd the client would send.
	ESP – ENCAPSULATION SECURITY PAYLOAD
	·        Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP) is a member of the Internet Protocol Security (IPsec) set of protocols that encrypt and authenticate the packets of data between computers using a Virtual Private Network (VPN).
·        The focus and layer on which ESP operates makes it possible for VPNs to function securely.
·        Example: “Security for a VPN involves IPsec, and with IPsec's protocols of AH and ESP, the connection between a user and a network is secure.
·        Going further ESP, on the application layer, can run in its more secure Tunnel Mode offering the most privacy.”
	CONNECTIONLESS VS CONNECTION ORIENTED
	·        Connection-oriented service involves the creation and termination of the connection for sending the data between two or more devices.
·        In contrast, connectionless service does not require establishing any connection and termination process for transferring the data over a network.
	NETWORK SERVICES
	·         
	DHCP
	·        The Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol is a network management protocol used on Internet Protocol networks for automatically assigning IP addresses and other communication parameters to devices connected to the network using a client–server architecture.
	SCOPE
	·        A scope is a consecutive range of IP addresses that a DHCP server can draw on to fulfill an IP address request from a DHCP client.
·        By defining one or more scopes on your DHCP server, the server can manage the distribution and assignment of IP addresses to DHCP clients.-
·        A valid IP address for the subnet to which it is connecting.
·        Requested DHCP options, which are additional parameters that a DHCP server is configured to assign to clients.
·        Some examples of DHCP options are Router (default gateway), DNS Servers, and DNS Domain Name.
	EXCUSION RANGES
	·        A DHCP exclusion range is a specified range of IP addresses residing within a DHCP range.
·        An exclusion range is defined as a start/end IP address pair within an ipam/range object and is considered a sub-object within a regular DHCP range.
·        An exclusion is an address or range of addresses taken from a DHCP scope that the DHCP server is not allowed to hand out.
·        For example, if you have set a DHCP server to exclude the address range 192.168. 0.1-192.168. 0.10 then the only way a computer on your network would get an address of 192.168.
	RESERVATION
	·        The Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) Reservation feature allows the router to reserve the lease of an IP Address for use of a specific device on your network, effectively ensuring that the router does not assign the IP Address to other devices in the network.
·        Reservations in DHCP allow a device to receive the same IP Address every time that it connects to the network.
·        DHCP Servers support something called a “DHCP Reservation”, which essentially allows you to provide a pre-set IP address to a specific client based on it's physical MAC address.
·        This means that the device will always get the same IP address and it will never change (whereas they typically do on occasion).
	DYNAMIC ASSIGNMENT
	·        it's the standard mechanism to dynamically assign IP addresses within a network.
	STATIC ASSIGNMENT
	·        Static DHCP assignment means the DHCP server assigns the same IP to the defined MAC address every time the device is connected to the network.
·        The DHCP server serves the reserved IP address when the device using the corresponding MAC address requests an IP address.
	LEASE TIME
	·        When DHCP sends configuration information to a client, the information is sent with a lease time.
·        This is the length of time that the client can use the IP address it has been assigned.
·        The duration of the lease time can be changed according to your specific requirement.
·        The standard DHCP lease time is 24 hours, but you can change it to meet your network's needs.
·        For example, if you're setting up a lease time on your restaurant's WiFi network, you can restrict it to an hour or two while a guest office network could have about 12 hours.
	SCOPE OPTIONS
	·        A DHCP scope is an administrative grouping of IP addresses for a network subnet.
·        With scopes you can configure common network settings for all clients receiving addresses, such as DNS servers and network gateways.
·        DHCP option 1: subnet mask to be applied on the interface asking for an IP address.
·        DHCP option 3: default router or last resort gateway for this interface.
·        DHCP option 6: which DNS (Domain Name Server) to include in the IP configuration for name resolution.
·        DHCP option 51: lease time for this IP address.
	AVAILABLE LEASES
	·        A DHCP lease is a temporary assignment of an IP address to a device on the network.
·        When using DHCP to manage a pool of IP addresses, each client served on the network is only “renting” its IP address.
·        Thus, IP addresses managed by a DHCP server are only assigned for a limited period of time.
	DHCP RELAY
	·        A DHCP relay agent is a host or router that forwards DHCP packets between clients and servers.
·        Network administrators can use the DHCP Relay service of the SD-WAN appliances to relay requests and replies between local DHCP Clients and a remote DHCP Server.
	IP HELPER / UDP FORWADING
	·        User Datagram Protocol (UDP) forwarding is a feature used in Cisco IOS software to forward broadcast and multicast packets received for a specific IP address.
·        Usage example — A UDP Helper Address is a special router configuration used to forward broadcast network traffic from a client machine on one subnet to a
	DNS
	·        The Domain Name System is the hierarchical and decentralized naming system used to identify computers, services, and other resources reachable through the Internet or other Internet Protocol networks.
·        The resource records contained in the DNS associate domain names with other forms of information.
·        For example, when a Web address (URL) is typed into a browser, a DNS query is made to learn an IP address of a Web server associated with that name.
·        Using the www.example.com URL, example.com is the domain name, and www is the hostname. DNS resolution maps www.example.com into an IP address (such as 192.0. 2.1).
	RECORD TYPES
	·        The most common DNS record types are: Address Mapping record (A Record)—also known as a DNS host record, stores a hostname and its corresponding IPv4 address.
·        IP Version 6 Address record (AAAA Record)—stores a hostname and its corresponding IPv6 address.
·        AAAA Maps domain names to IPv6 addresses
·        CNAME Redirects a domain to a different domain
·        PTR         Resolves IPv4 or IPv6 addresses to domain names
·        NS           Provides a list of the authoritative name servers responsible for the domain
	ADDRESS A VS AAAA
	·        A and AAAA records are equally important when it comes to resolving DNS.
·        The difference lies in that A records is used to resolve a hostname which corresponds to an IPv4 address, while AAAA records are used to resolve a domain name which corresponds to an IPv6 address.
·        AAAA records are very similar to A records in that they point a domain name to an IP address.
·        The catch is, the IP address isn't a typical IPv4 address like: 255.255. 255.0. Instead, AAAA records point to IPv6 addresses like: 2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334.
	CNAME – CANONICAL NAME
	·        A Canonical Name or CNAME record is a type of DNS record that maps an alias name to a true or canonical domain name.
·        CNAME records are typically used to map a subdomain such as www or mail to the domain hosting that subdomain's content.
·        A common example is the www subdomain which is provided as an alias to the root domain name - users accessing “www.example.com” are referred to the root domain (or DNS zone apex) “example.com”.
	MX – MAIL EXCHANGE
	·        A DNS 'mail exchange' (MX) record directs email to a mail server.
·        The MX record indicates how email messages should be routed in accordance with the Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP, the standard protocol for all email).
·        Like CNAME records, an MX record must always point to another domain.
	SOA – START OF AUTHORITY
	·        The DNS 'start of authority' (SOA) record stores important information about a domain or zone such as the email address of the administrator, when the domain was last updated, and how long the server should wait between refreshes.
·        All DNS zones need an SOA record in order to conform to IETF standards.
·        name example.com
·        RNAME              admin.example.com
·        SERIAL               1111111111
·        REFRESH           86400
·        RETRY             7200
	PTR – POINTER
	·        A PTR (or Pointer) record is a security tool.
·        Essentially, when you receive an email, your mail server uses the PTR record that comes in with the email message to check that the mail server sending the email matches the IP address that it claims to be using.
·        This is also known as “reverse DNS lookup.”
·        While DNS A records are stored under the given domain name, DNS PTR records are stored under the IP address — reversed, and with ". in-addr.arpa" added.
·        For example, the PTR record for the IP address 192.0. 2.255 would be stored under "255.2.0.192.in-addr.arpa".
	TXT – TEXT
	·        TXT records are a type of Domain Name System (DNS) record that contains text information for sources outside of your domain.
·        You add these records to your domain settings.
·        You can use TXT records for various purposes.
·        Google uses them to verify domain ownership and to ensure email security.
·        Use case                        Name/Host/Alias        Record Type
·        Subdomain verification        the name of your subdomain. If your subdomain is sub.example.com, write "sub" for the Host.  TXT
·        SPF record                    Blank or @   TXT
·        DKIM signing                           Text from the DNS Host name (TXT record name) field in the Google Admin console            TXT
·        DMARC authentication         _dmarc             TXT
	SRV – SERVICE
	·        A Service record is a specification of data in the Domain Name System defining the location
·        the hostname and port number, of servers for specified services. It is defined in RFC 2782, and its type code is 33.
·        So, our example SRV record would actually look like: _xmpp._tcp.example.com. 86400 IN SRV 10 5 5223 server.example.com.
·        In the above example, "_xmpp" indicates the type of service (the XMPP protocol) and "_tcp" indicates the TCP transport protocol, while "example.com" is the host, or the domain name.
	NS – NAME SERVER
	·        NS stands for 'nameserver,' and the nameserver record indicates which DNS server is authoritative for that domain (i.e. which server contains the actual DNS
·        A DNS Name Server (NS) record specifies the domain name of the name server servicing a particular domain.
·        For example, an NS record with a time-to-live (TTL) of 1100 seconds, and for the com domain serviced by the name server a.gtld-servers.net , would be defined as below: com. 1100 IN NS a.gtld-servers.net.
	GLOBAL HIERARCHY
	·        DNS uses a hierarchy to manage its distributed database system.
·        The DNS hierarchy, also called the domain name space, is an inverted tree structure, much like eDirectory.
·        The DNS tree has a single domain at the top of the structure called the root domain.
·        A period or dot (.) is the designation for the root domain.
·        The DNS hierarchy, also called the domain name space, is an inverted tree structure, much like eDirectory.
·        The DNS tree has a single domain at the top of the structure called the root domain. A period or dot (.) is the designation for the root domain.
·        .int          International organizations, as in nato.int
	ROOT DNS SERVERS
	·        Root servers, or DNS root servers, are name servers that are responsible for the functionality of the DNS as well as the entire Internet.
·        They're the first step in the name resolution of any domain name, meaning they translate domain names into IP addresses.
·        A root name server is a name server for the root zone of the Domain Name System of the Internet.
·        It directly answers requests for records in the root zone and answers other requests by returning a list of the authoritative name servers for the appropriate top-level domain.
·        Root name servers are the servers at the root of the Domain Name System (DNS) hierarchy.
·        The DNS is the system which converts Internet domain names, such as www.netnod.se, into numeric addresses such as 192.71. 80.67 or 2a01:3f0:1:3::67.
	INTERNAL VS EXTERNAL
	·        If you mean Internal as the DNS that may provide you firewall, it is your own DNS that is resolving (or forwarding requests) in your internal LAN.
·        On the other side, the external DNS is the public DNS that resolves the domain request from internet
	ZONE TRANSFERS
	·        DNS zone transfer, also sometimes known by the inducing DNS query type AXFR, is a type of DNS transaction.
·        AXFR is a protocol for “zone transfers” for replication of DNS data across multiple DNS servers.
·        Unlike normal DNS queries that require the user to know some DNS information ahead of time, AXFR queries reveal resource records including subdomain names
·        It is one of the many mechanisms available for administrators to replicate DNS databases across a set of DNS servers.
·        A DNS zone is a portion of the domain name space that is served by a DNS server.
·        For example, example.com with all its subdomains may be a zone.
·        However, second.example.com may also be a separate zone.
	AUTHORIATIVE NAME SERVERS
	·        An authoritative server is the authority for its zone.
·        It queries and is queried by other name servers in the DNS.
·        The data it receives in response from other name servers is cached.
·        Authoritative servers are not authoritative for cached data.
·        In some cases, the Authoritative Name Server will route the DNS Resolver to another Name Server that contains specific records for a subdomain,
·        for example, support.example.com. Authoritative Name Servers are organized using DNS Zones.
·        Each DNS zone has a closed set of Authoritative Name Servers.
	TTL – TIME TO LIVE
	·        DNS TTL (time to live) is a setting that tells the DNS resolver how long to cache a query before requesting a new one.
·        The information gathered is then stored in the cache of the recursive or local resolver for the TTL before it reaches back out to collect new, updated details.
·        TTL times are always represented in seconds; for example, 300 seconds equals 5 minutes to live. Jun 17, 2020
·        Lowest TTL: 1
·        Average TTL: 6468
·        Highest TTL: 129,540
·        Median TTL: 300
	DNS CACHING
	·        DNS cache refers to the temporary storage of information about previous DNS lookups on a machine's OS or web browser.
·        Keeping a local copy of a DNS lookup allows your OS or browser to quickly retrieve it and thus a website's URL can be resolved to its corresponding IP much more efficiently.
·        (Domain Name System cache) The storage location of IP addresses of websites for faster retrieval of subsequent DNS queries (URL to IP).
·        The caches are located in the user's computer as well as in company and ISP servers.
	REVERSE DNS / REVERSE LOOKUP / FORWARD LOOKUP
	·        Reverse DNS
·        a reverse DNS lookup or reverse DNS resolution is the querying technique of the Domain Name System to determine the domain name associated with an IP address
·        the reverse of the usual "forward" DNS lookup of an IP address from a domain name.
·        Forward-confirmed reverse DNS, also known as full-circle reverse DNS, double-reverse DNS, or iprev, is a networking parameter configuration in which a given IP address has both forward and reverse Domain Name System entries that match each other.
·        Reverse DNS
·        PTR records store reverse DNS entries, with their IP address reversed and .in-addr.arpa appended to each record.
·        For example, PTR stores the IP address 198.15. 93.98 as 98.93.15.198.in-addr.arpa , pointing back to its designated host name.
·        Reverse Lookup
·        Using rDNS, the IP address is reversed and then the in-addr.arpa is added to the end.
·        For example, if we use the IPv4 address of 67.227. 187.136, using rDNS, it would become 136.187.227.67.in-addr.arpa.
·        This method of reverse DNS resolution of an IP address uses a PTR record.
·        Forward Lookup
·        So for example client asks “What is IP address for AS-DCO001.mustbegeek.com?”on its query.
·        The DNS server then lookup at the value on column “Data” where “Name” value equals to AS-DCO001.mustbegeek.com, and this resulting in address 192.168. 0.7 as the answer.
·         
	RECURSIVE LOOKUP / ITERATIVE LOOKUP
	·        A recursive DNS lookup is where one DNS server communicates with several other DNS servers to hunt down an IP address and return it to the client.
·        This is in contrast to an iterative DNS query, where the client communicates directly with each DNS server involved in the lookup.
·        An iterative DNS query is a request for a website name or uniform resource locator (URL) that the domain name system (DNS) server responds to with the IP address from its zone file cache, if possible.
·        If the server doesn't have the IP address requested, it forwards the request on to another DNS server.
	NTP
	·        The Network Time Protocol is a networking protocol for clock synchronization between computer systems over packet-switched, variable-latency data networks.
·        NTP is one of the oldest Internet protocols in current use.
·        A good example of a NTP server is ntp.pool.org.
·        This is a cluster of NTP servers that many servers and network devices use to synchronize their clocks.
·        NTP uses a concept called “stratum” that defines how many NTP hops away a device is from an authorative time source.
	STRATUM
	·        The NTP Stratum model is a representation of the hierarchy of time servers in an NTP network, where the Stratum level (0-15) indicates the device's distance to the reference clock.
·        Stratum 0 means a device is directly connected to e.g., a GPS antenna.
·        Stratum 1 refers to any machine that synchronizes its system clock directly with the 'reference' clock that resides at Stratum 0.
·        For example, a server that has a GPS unit plugged into one of its serial ports.
·        Stratum 2 refers to any machine that synchronizes its system clock with the clock on a Stratum 1 server.
	CLIENT - SERVER
	·        The Network Time Protocol (NTP) is a client/server application.
·        Each workstation, router, or server must be equipped with NTP client software to synchronize its clock to the network time server.
·        In most cases the client software is already resident in the operating system of each device.
	NETWORK ARCHITECTURE
	·        Network architecture is the design of a computer network.
·        It is a framework for the specification of a network's physical components and their functional organization and configuration, its operational principles and procedures, as well as communication protocols used.
·        Examples include the Transmission Control Protocol / Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) used by networks to connect to the Internet,
·        the Ethernet protocol for connecting one computer to another, and
·        the File Transfer Protocol for sending and receiving files to and from a server.
	THREE TIRES
	·        Three-tier architecture is a well-established software application architecture that organizes applications into three logical and physical computing tiers:
·        the presentation tier, or user interface;
·        the application tier, where data is processed; and
·        the data tier, where the data associated with the application is
·        This can be a relational database management system such as PostgreSQL, MySQL, MariaDB, Oracle, DB2, Informix or Microsoft SQL Server, or in a NoSQL Database server such as Cassandra, CouchDB or MongoDB.
·        In a three-tier application, all communication goes through the application tier.
	CORE
	·        In telecommunications, the core network is the central element of a network that provides services to customers who are connected by the access network.
·        A core network is a collection of network hardware, devices, and software that provides the fundamental services for your organization's information technology (IT) needs.
·        Core protocols for network connectivity between computers and other Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) compatible devices.
	DISTRIBUTION / AGGREGATION LAYER
	·        The distribution layer aggregates the data received from the access layer switches before it is transmitted to the core layer for routing to its final destination.
·        The aggregation (or distribution) layer aggregates the uplinks from the access layer to the data center core.
·        This layer is the critical point for control and application services.
	ACCESS / EDGE
	·        The access edge is the part of the infrastructure edge closest to the end-user and their devices.
·        Edge data centers will be placed at regular intervals in urban and suburban environments such as the cable or telco headend or the base of a cell tower.
	SDN – SOFTWARE DEFINED NETWORKING
	·        Software-defined networking technology is an approach to network management that enables dynamic, programmatically efficient network configuration in order to improve network performance and monitoring, making it more like cloud computing than traditional network management.
·        SDN controllers are being sold in market by many big networking vendors/companies.
·        Some examples of these controllers are Cisco Open SDN controller, Juniper Contrail, Brocade SDN controller, and PFC SDN controller from NEC.
·        Many Open source SDN controllers like Opendaylight, Floodlight, Beacon, Ryu etc.
	APPLICATION LAYER
	·        SDN Application Layer is basically the main layer using which the SD communicates with the programs.
·        It uses the resources from the SDN controller (second layer) using various APIs (Application Programming Interfaces).
·        The SDN application layer, not surprisingly, contains the typical network applications or functions like intrusion detection systems, load balancing or firewalls.
	CONTROL LAYER
	·        The control layer is considered as the brain of SDN.
·        The intelligence to this layer is provided by centralized SDN controller software.
·        This controller resides on a server and manages policies and the flow of traffic throughout the network. The physical switches in the network constitute the infrastructure layer.
	INFRASTRUCTURE LAYER
	The Infrastructure Layer
·        This consists of networking devices that control the forwarding and data processing capabilities for the network.
·        The devices are responsible for handling packets based on the rules provided by a controller.
Infrastructure layer in SDN
·        The infrastructure layer is made up of the physical switches in the network.
·        These switches forward the network traffic to their destinations.
	MANAGEMENT PLANE
	·        SDN is a networking technology that entirely eliminates the distributed control plane, and moves its functionality into a centralized management plane (called the control plane in SDN terminology).
·        The management plane contains the traffic used by the network administrator to manage the network.
·        It can be HTTP (if you used a web UI), SSH, SNMP. Basically, the traffic is characterized like this:
·        Management plane: User<->devices to configure devices (e.g., SNMP or SSH)
	SPINE AND LEAF
	·        Spine and Leaf Architecture is a two-layer, full-mesh topology composed of a leaf layer and a spine layer, with the leaf and spine switches.
·        It was originally implemented in data centers to overcome the limitations of the three-tier architecture, where we have more east-west traffic than north-south traffic flow.
·        The spine layer is made up of switches that perform routing, working as the backbone of the network.
·        The leaf layer involves an access switch that connects to endpoints like servers, storage devices.
·        In a leaf-spine architecture, every leaf switch is interconnected with each spine switch.
	SOFTWARE DEFINED NETWORKING
	·        Software-defined networking technology is an approach to network management that enables dynamic, programmatically efficient network configuration in order to improve network performance and monitoring, making it more like cloud computing than traditional network management.
·        SDN controllers are being sold in market by many big networking vendors/companies.
·        Some examples of these controllers are Cisco Open SDN controller, Juniper Contrail, Brocade SDN controller, and PFC SDN controller from NEC.
·        Many Open source SDN controllers like Opendaylight, Floodlight, Beacon, Ryu etc.
	TOP OF RACK SWITCHING
	·        Top-of-rack switching is a data center architecture design in which computing equipment like servers, appliances and other switches located within the same or adjacent rack are connected to an in-rack network switch.
·        When it comes to server connecting in data center, network switch is a vital part.
·        You may hear about it that top-of-rack switch is very popular to support power required for large installations and the ToR design is very convenient for servers to connect.
·        In the top-of-rack design, servers connect to one Ethernet switch or two (for example, gigabit Ethernet switch or 10GbE switch) installed inside the rack.
·        The top-of-rack switch is usually placed at the top of the server rack for easier accessibility and cleaner cable management, which is the coming of its name.
	BACKBONE
	·        A backbone or core network is a part of a computer network which interconnects networks, providing a path for the exchange of information between different LANs or subnetworks.
·        A backbone can tie together diverse networks in the same building, in different buildings in a campus environment, or over wide areas.
·        Backbone Network example
·        The pieces of the network connections (for example: ethernet, wireless) that bring these departments together is often mentioned as network backbone.
·        Network congestion is often taken into consideration while designing backbones.
·        One example of a backbone network is the Internet backbone.
	TRAFFIC FLOWS
	·        In packet switching networks, traffic flow, packet flow or network flow is a sequence of packets from a source computer to a destination, which may be another host, a multicast group, or a broadcast domain.
·        RFC 2722 defines traffic flow as "an artificial logical equivalent to a call or connection."
	NORTH SOUTH
	·        North-south traffic is the movement of data packets that are initially entering a network from the outside.
·        These packets may have exited a different network, such as the public Internet or a data center, before entering the current one.
·        North-south traffic usually includes queries, commands, and data in general, being requested from a data center or stored in one.
	EAST WEST
	·        east-west traffic is network traffic among devices within a specific data center.
·        The other direction of traffic flow is north-south traffic, data flowing from or to a system physically residing outside the data center.
·        For instance, east-west traffic occurs when routers within a data center exchange table information, or when a LAN client communicates with a server in the data center.
	BRANCH OFFICE VS ON PERMISES
	·        Many organizations have multiple offices spread out around the country or the globe.
·        These branch offices use a “branch network” or “branch security network” of some sort that encompasses the traffic to and from those offices to connect employees to corporate resources.
·        A on-premises network is a network within the organization that can be securely accessed by only the employees.
·        It is like the corporate IT network.
·        On the contrary, a public network can be accessed by any user and is an untrusted network.
	DATACENTER VS COLOCATION
	·        A data centre is a purpose-built facility designed to efficiently store, power, cool and connect your IT infrastructure.
·        Colocation is one of many services data centres provide, and is the act of hosting your IT hardware (like servers) outside of your premises and in a data centre.
·        The terms are sometimes used interchangeably, but properly speaking, a colocation data center is when a data center company rents out the entire facility to another company.
·        A colocation rack, on the other hand, is when they rent out rack space within a data center to multiple companies.
	SAN – STORAGE AREA NETWORKS
	·        A storage area network or storage network is a computer network which provides access to consolidated, block-level data storage.
·        SANs are primarily used to access data storage devices, such as disk arrays and tape libraries from servers so that the devices appear to the operating system as direct-attached storage.
·        SAN is a network of disks that is accessed by a network of servers.
·        There are several popular uses for SANs in enterprise computing.
·        A SAN is typically employed to consolidate storage.
·        For example, it's common for a computer system, such as a server, to include one or more local storage devices.
	CONNECTION TYPES
	·        The most common SAN protocols are: Fibre Channel Protocol (FCP). The most widely used SAN or block protocol, deployed in 70% to 80% of the total SAN market.
·        FCP uses Fibre Channel transport protocols with embedded SCSI commands.
	FCOE – FIBRE CHANNEL OVER ETHERNET
	·        Fibre Channel over Ethernet is a computer network technology that encapsulates Fibre Channel frames over Ethernet networks.
·        This allows Fibre Channel to use 10 Gigabit Ethernet networks while preserving the Fibre Channel protocol.
	FIBRE CHANNEL
	·        Fibre Channel is a high-speed data transfer protocol providing in-order, lossless delivery of raw block data.
·        Fibre Channel is primarily used to connect computer data storage to servers in storage area networks in commercial data centers.
	ISCSI - INTERNET SMALL COMPUTER SYSTEM INTERFACE
	·        iSCSI is an acronym that stands for Internet Small Computer System Interface.
·        It is a storage area networking (SAN) protocol used to send block storage from storage arrays or devices to client computers that aren't directly connected to those devices.
·        Internet Small Computer Systems Interface or iSCSI is an Internet Protocol-based storage networking standard for linking data storage facilities.
·        iSCSI provides block-level access to storage devices by carrying SCSI commands over a TCP/IP network.
	CLOUD CONCEPTS
	·         
	DEPLOYMENT METHODS
	·         
	PUBLIC vs PRIVATE vs HYBRID vs COMMUNITY
	·        Public cloud is cloud computing that's delivered via the internet and shared across organizations.
·        Private cloud is cloud computing that is dedicated solely to your organization.
·        Hybrid cloud is any environment that uses both public and private clouds.
·        A hybrid cloud is defined as a mixed computing, storage, and services environment that is made up of a public cloud solution, private cloud services, and an on-premises infrastructure.
·        Examples of this include Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Microsoft Azure. 
·        A community cloud in computing is a collaborative effort in which infrastructure is shared between several organizations from a specific community with common concerns, whether managed internally or by a third-party and hosted internally or externally.
·        From a technical standpoint, community cloud is a multitenant platform that is accessible only for a specific subset of customers.
·        A good example is the U.S.-based dedicated IBM SoftLayer cloud for federal agencies.
	ROOT DNS SERVERS
	·        Root servers, or DNS root servers, are name servers that are responsible for the functionality of the DNS as well as the entire Internet.
·        They're the first step in the name resolution of any domain name, meaning they translate domain names into IP addresses.
·        A root name server is a name server for the root zone of the Domain Name System of the Internet.
·        It directly answers requests for records in the root zone and answers other requests by returning a list of the authoritative name servers for the appropriate top-level domain.
·        Root name servers are the servers at the root of the Domain Name System (DNS) hierarchy.
·        The DNS is the system which converts Internet domain names, such as www.netnod.se, into numeric addresses such as 192.71. 80.67 or 2a01:3f0:1:3::67.
	INTERNAL VS EXTERNAL
	·        If you mean Internal as the DNS that may provide you firewall, it is your own DNS that is resolving (or forwarding requests) in your internal LAN.
·        On the other side, the external DNS is the public DNS that resolves the domain request from internet
	ZONE TRANSFERS
	·        DNS zone transfer, also sometimes known by the inducing DNS query type AXFR, is a type of DNS transaction.
·        AXFR is a protocol for “zone transfers” for replication of DNS data across multiple DNS servers.
·        Unlike normal DNS queries that require the user to know some DNS information ahead of time, AXFR queries reveal resource records including subdomain names
·        It is one of the many mechanisms available for administrators to replicate DNS databases across a set of DNS servers.
·        A DNS zone is a portion of the domain name space that is served by a DNS server.
·        For example, example.com with all its subdomains may be a zone.
·        However, second.example.com may also be a separate zone.
	SERVICE MODELS
	·        Cloud computing is offered in three different service models which each satisfy a unique set of business requirements.
·        These three models are known as Software as a Service (SaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS), and Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS).
·        some examples of cloud services? Common SaaS services include Dropbox, Salesforce, Cisco WebEx.
·        PaaS services include Google App Engine, Apache Stratos and OpenShift.
·        Some well-known IaaS services are Amazon Web Services (AWS), Cisco Metapod and Microsoft Azure.

	PAAS – PLATFORM AS A SERVICE
	·        PaaS, or Platform-as-a-Service, is a cloud computing model that provides customers a complete cloud platform—hardware, software, and infrastructure—for developing, running, and managing applications without the cost, complexity, and inflexibility that often comes with building and maintaining that platform on-premises.
·        Platform as a service or application platform as a service or platform-based service is a category of cloud computing services that allows customers to provision, instantiate, run, and manage a modular 
·        PaaS- AWS Elastic Beanstalk, Windows Azure, Heroku, Force.com, Google App Engine, Apache Stratos, OpenShift
	DAAS – DESKTOP AS A SERVICE
	·        Desktop as a Service (DaaS) is a cloud computing offering where a service provider delivers virtual desktops to end users over the Internet, licensed with a per-user subscription.
·        There are numerous providers that offer desktop as a service.
·        Two of the best-known DaaS vendors are Citrix Managed Desktops and VMware Horizon Cloud.
·        However, Amazon is beginning to establish itself as a major DaaS player with its Amazon Web Services (AWS) Workspaces, as is Microsoft with Windows Virtual Desktop.
	INFRASTRUCTURE AS A CODE
	·        Infrastructure as code is the process of managing and provisioning computer data centers through machine-readable definition files, rather than physical hardware configuration or interactive configuration tools.
·        Examples of infrastructure-as-code tools include AWS CloudFormation, Red Hat Ansible, Chef, Puppet, SaltStack and HashiCorp Terraform.
·        Some tools rely on a domain-specific language (DSL), while others use a standard template format, such as YAML and JSON.
	AUTOMATION / ORCHESTATION
	·        Cloud orchestration is the automation of disparate automations across services and clouds.
·        It connects automated tasks to create a cohesive workflow that helps the enterprise achieve its goals.
·        In short, cloud orchestration is the automation of automations.
·        A good example of cloud automation is Facebook.
·        This social media platform uses cloud automation to scale the system and maintain its availability to users without significant hiccups.
·        The system monitors the workload and allocates resources accordingly.
·        Cloud orchestration is the framework that ties together all of the automation routines across various services and clouds. Combined with automation, orchestration enables efficient service of the cloud infrastructure.
	CONNECTIVITY OPTIONS
	·        Utilizing Network Service Provider Direct WAN Connectivity for the Cloud, there are three common cloud connectivity options: internet, cloud internet (exchange-based) and direct WAN.
·        cloud direct connect is a connection between a private network and a public cloud.
·        In the past, all connections to the cloud were from a public network into a public cloud, but with the rise of new technologies, different types of clouds have become available, including public, private, and hybrid.
	VPN – VIRTUAL PRIVATE NETWORKS
	·        Cloud VPN securely connects your peer network to your Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) network through an IPsec VPN connection.
·        Traffic traveling between the two networks is encrypted by one VPN gateway and then decrypted by the other VPN gateway.
·        This action protects your data as it travels over the internet.
·        For example, employees at a branch office could use a VPN to connect to the main office's internal network.
·        Alternatively, a remote worker, who may be working from home, could need to connect to their company's internet or restricted applications.
	PRIVATE DIRECT CONNECTION TO CLOUD PROVIDER
	·        A cloud direct connect establishes a dedicated network connection from your premises to one or more cloud providers.
·        This makes it possible for your business to establish private connectivity between the cloud provider and your data center, office or colocation environment.
·        Popular cloud direct connect services are from all of the major cloud providers like Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud, IBM Cloud, Oracle Cloud, Salesforce.com, SAP, Netsuite, Nutanix, and more.
	MULTITENANCY
	·        A tenant is a group of users who share a common access with specific privileges to the software instance.
·        A multi-tenant cloud is a cloud computing architecture that allows customers to share computing resources in a public or private cloud.
·        Each tenant's data is isolated and remains invisible to other tenants.
·        In a multi-tenant cloud system, users have individualized space for storing their projects and data.
·        In cloud computing Multitenancy also refer as shared host where same resources are divided among different customer's.
·        For Example: The example of multitenancy is same as working of Bank.
·        Multiple people can store money in the one same bank.
	ELASTICITY
	·        elasticity is defined as "the degree to which a system is able to adapt to workload changes by provisioning and de-provisioning resources in an autonomic manner, such that at each point in time the available resources match the current demand as closely as possible".
·        Cloud elasticity enables a “pay as you go” cost model, in which you're only charged for the resources that you actually consume.
·        For example, Amazon claims that customers who use the AWS Instance Scheduler with Amazon EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud) can realize savings of up to 70 percent.
	SCALABILITY
	·        Cloud scalability in cloud computing refers to the ability to increase or decrease IT resources as needed to meet changing demand.
·        Scalability is one of the hallmarks of the cloud and the primary driver of its exploding popularity with businesses.
·        Cloud scalability is all about adding or reducing IT resources to meet changes in demand.
·        It's the ability of a system to accommodate larger or smaller loads.
·        Businesses can scale up or down (vertically) and out or in (horizontally).
·        For example, scaling up makes hardware stronger; scaling out adds additional nodes.
	SECURITY IMPLICATIONS
	·        In terms of security risk for cloud services, data protection is critical.
·        Cloud computing may bring a layer of vulnerability to users due to the nature of a remotely hosted server, but they are not more susceptible to cyber criminals, attacks, and security threats than on-site services and providers.
·        The ease of data sharing in the cloud – while a major asset and key to collaboration in the cloud – creates serious concerns regarding data loss or leakage.
·        In fact, 69% of organizations point to this as their greatest cloud security concern.
	NETWORK IMPLEMENATIONS

	ROUTING TECHNOLOGIES  
	·        Internet Technologies. A route is the path that data takes when travelling through a network from one host to another.
·        Routing is the process by which the path, or some subset of it, is determined.
·        Dynamic routing dominates the Internet. Examples of dynamic-routing protocols and algorithms include Routing Information Protocol (RIP), Open Shortest Path First (OSPF) and Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol (EIGRP).
	ROUTING
	·        Routing is the process of selecting a path for traffic in a network or between or across multiple networks.
·        Broadly, routing is performed in many types of networks, including circuit-switched networks, such as the public switched telephone network, and computer networks, such as the Internet.
·         
	DYNAMIC ROUTING
	·        Dynamic routing, also called adaptive routing, is a process where a router can forward data via a different route for a given destination based on the current conditions of the communication circuits within a system.
·        Example of dynamic routing protocols are BGP, EIGRP, OSPF and RIP that you can choose according to your topology, specific requirements ( like scenario: WAN, Internet Edge, Data Center, SP networks), technical capabilities (vendor, type of devices, supported protocols) and so on.
	RIP – ROUTING INTERNET PROTOCOL
	·        Routing Information Protocol (RIP) is a distance-vector routing protocol.
·        Routers running the distance-vector protocol send all or a portion of their routing tables in routing-update messages to their neighbors.
·        You can use RIP to configure the hosts as part of a RIP network.
·        The Routing Information Protocol is one of the oldest distance-vector routing protocols which employs the hop count as a routing metric.
·        RIP prevents routing loops by implementing a limit on the number of hops allowed in a path from source to destination.
·        It is a distance-vector routing protocol that has an AD value of 120 and works on the Network layer of the OSI model. RIP uses port number 520.

	OSPF – OPEN SHORTEST PATH FIRST PROTOCOL
	·        The OSPF (Open Shortest Path First) protocol is one of a family of IP Routing protocols, and is an Interior Gateway Protocol (IGP) for the Internet, used to distribute IP routing information throughout a single Autonomous System (AS) in an IP network.
·        Open Shortest Path First is a routing protocol for Internet Protocol networks.
·        It uses a link state routing algorithm and falls into the group of interior gateway protocols, operating within a single autonomous system.
·        OSPF will listen to neighbors and gather all link state data available to build a topology map of all available paths in its network and then save the information in its topology database, also known as its Link-State Database (LSDB). Using the information from its topology database.
	EIGRP – ENHANCED INTERIOR GATEWAY PROTOCOL
	·        Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol (EIGRP) is a network protocol that enables routers to exchange information more efficiently than earlier network protocols, such as Interior Gateway Routing Protocol (IGRP) or Border Gateway Protocol (BGP).
·        Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol is an advanced distance-vector routing protocol that is used on a computer network for automating routing decisions and configuration.
·        The protocol was designed by Cisco Systems as a proprietary protocol, available only on Cisco routers.
·        The EIGRP transport mechanism uses a mix of multicast and unicast packets, using reliable delivery when necessary. All transmissions use IP with the protocol type field set to 88. The IP multicast address used is 224.0. 0.10.
	BGP – BORDER GATEWAY PROTOCOL
	·        Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) refers to a gateway protocol that enables the internet to exchange routing information between autonomous systems (AS).
·        As networks interact with each other, they need a way to communicate.
·        This is accomplished through peering. BGP makes peering possible.
·        Border Gateway Protocol is a standardized exterior gateway protocol designed to exchange routing and reachability information among autonomous systems on the Internet.
·        The BGP decision-making mechanism analyzes all the data and sets one of its peers as the next stop, to forward packets for a certain destination.
·        Each peer manages a table with all the routes it knows for each network and propagates that information to its neighboring autonomous systems.
	LINKSTATE VS DISTANCE VECTOR VS HYBRID
	·        Link-state routing protocols are one of the two main classes of routing protocols used in packet switching networks for computer communications, the other being distance-vector routing protocols.
·        Examples of link-state routing protocols include Open Shortest Path First and Intermediate System to Intermediate System.
·        A distance-vector routing protocol in data networks determines the best route for data packets based on distance.
·        Distance-vector routing protocols measure the distance by the number of routers a packet has to pass, one router counts as one hop.
·        For example, A will share its routing table with neighbors B and C and neighbors B and C will share their routing table with A.
·        Step 2 − If the path via a neighbor has a lower cost, then the router updates its local table to forward packets to the neighbor.
·        Hybrid Routing Protocol (HRP) is a network routing protocol that combines Distance Vector Routing Protocol (DVRP) and Link State Routing Protocol (LSRP) features.
·        HRP is used to determine optimal network destination routes and report network topology data modifications.
·        An example of hybrid routing protocol is zone routing protocol (ZRP).
·        For route constitution within the nodes neighborhood ZRP uses proactive mechanism, it takes the advantages of reactive protocols for communication between the neighborhoods.
	STATIC ROUTING
	·        Static routing is a form of routing that occurs when a router uses a manually-configured routing entry, rather than information from dynamic routing traffic.
·        In production networks, static routes are mainly configured when routing from a particular network to a stub network.
·        stub networks are networks that can only be accessed through one point or one interface.
·        Parameter        Meaning           example
·        Ip route             State that the route being configured is a static route           Ip route
	DEFAULT ROUTE
	·        the default route is a configuration of the Internet Protocol that establishes a forwarding rule for packets when no specific address of a next-hop host is available from the routing table or other routing mechanisms.
·        The default route in IPv4 is designated as 0.0. 0.0/0 or simply 0/0.
·        Similarly, in IPv6, the default route is specified as::/0.
·        The subnet mask /0 specifies all networks, and is the shortest match possible.
	ADMINISTRATIVE DISTANCE
	·        Administrative distance or route preference is a number of arbitrary units assigned to dynamic routes, static routes and directly-connected routes.
·        The value is used in routers to rank routes from most preferred to least preferred.
·        For example, Cisco routers, routes issued by OSPF have a lower default administrative distance than routes issued by the Routing Information Protocol.

	EXTERIOR VS INTERIOR
	·        Exterior routing protocols are used to exchange routing information between autonomous systems.
·        The routing information passed between autonomous systems is called reachability information
·        Reachability information is simply information about which networks can be reached through a specific autonomous system.
·        An autonomous system (AS) in networking is a collection of one or more associated Internet Protocol (IP) prefixes with a clearly defined routing policy that governs how the AS exchanges routing information with other autonomous systems.
·        A type of routing protocol used to distribute routing information between different autonomous systems in large internetworks based on the TCP/IP protocol.
·        The Internet is one example of an Exterior Gateway Protocol (EGP).
·        Routing protocols are divided into two general groups: interior and exterior protocols.
·        An interior protocol is a routing protocol used inside - interior to - an independent network system.
·        In TCP/IP terminology, these independent network systems are called autonomous systems.
·        examples of IGPs include Open Shortest Path First (OSPF), Routing Information Protocol (RIP), Intermediate System to Intermediate System (IS-IS) and Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol (EIGRP).
·        Interior routing protocols are used to administer several domains.
·        Interior routing protocols are used to communicate within a single autonomous system.
·        Exterior routing protocols are used to communicate between multiple autonomous systems.
Working
·        Interior - An interior gateway protocol (IGP) is a dynamic route update protocol used between routers that run on TCP/IP hosts within a single autonomous system.
·        The routers use this protocol to exchange information about IP routes.
·        Exterior - Exterior routing protocols are used to exchange routing information between autonomous systems.
·        The routing information passed between autonomous systems is called reachability information.
·        Reachability information is simply information about which networks can be reached through a specific autonomous system.
	TIME TO LIVE
	·        Time to live (TTL) refers to the amount of time or “hops” that a packet is set to exist inside a network before being discarded by a router.
·        TTL is also used in other contexts including CDN caching and DNS caching.
·        A CDN, or content delivery network, caches content (such as images, videos, or webpages) in proxy servers that are located closer to end users than origin servers.
·        (A proxy server is a server that receives requests from clients and passes them along to other servers.)
·        DNS caching allows any DNS server or client to locally store the DNS records and re-use them in the future – eliminating the need for new DNS queries.
·        The Domain Name System implements a time-to-live (TTL) on every DNS record.
·        TTL specifies the number of seconds the record can be cached by a DNS client or server.
·        Every time a router receives a packet, it subtracts one from the TTL count and then passes it onto the next location in the network.
·        If at any point the TTL count is equal to zero after the subtraction, the router will discard the packet and send an ICMP message back to the originating host.
	BANDWIDTH MANAGEMENT
	·        Bandwidth management is the process of measuring and controlling the communications on a network link, to avoid filling the link to capacity or overfilling the link, which would result in network congestion and poor performance of the network.
·         
	TRAFFIC SHAPING
	·        Traffic shaping is a bandwidth management technique used on computer networks which delays some or all datagrams to bring them into compliance with a desired traffic profile.
·        The application-based traffic shaping technique prioritizes the data packets of some applications over others—for example, the voice data packets of a VoIP over the basic data packets of a browser.
·        Traffic shaping (also known as packet shaping) is bandwidth management technique that delays the flow of certain types of network packets in order to ensure network performance for higher priority applications.
·        For example, it is typical to allocate maximum bandwidth to a business-critical application that is sensitive to latency such as a Voice-over-IP (VoIP), while throttling peer-to-peer file-sharing networks such as BitTorrent with application-based traffic-shaping.
	QOS – QUALITY OF SERVICE
	·        Quality of service is the description or measurement of the overall performance of a service, such as a telephony or computer network or a cloud computing service, particularly the performance seen by the users of the network.
·        QoS can tell a router how to use bandwidth.
·        For example, assigning a certain amount of bandwidth to different queues for different traffic types.
·        Delay: The time it takes for a packet to go from its source to its end destination.
	ETHERNET SWITCHING FEATURES
	 
	DATA VLAN – VIRTUAL LOCAL AREA NETWORK
	·        A VLAN (virtual LAN) is a subnetwork which can group together collections of devices on separate physical local area networks (LANs).
·        A LAN is a group of computers and devices that share a communications line or wireless link to a server within the same geographical area.
·        Each virtual switch, or VLAN, is simply a number assigned to each switch port.
·        For example, the two switch ports in the red mini-switch might be assigned to VLAN #10. The two ports in the orange mini-switch might be assigned to VLAN #20.
·        Virtual Local Area Networks (VLANs) separate an existing physical network into multiple logical networks.
·        Thus, each VLAN creates its own broadcast domain.
·        Communication between two VLANs can only occur through a router that is connected to both.
·        VLANs work as though they are created using independent switches.
	VOICE VLAN
	·        The voice VLAN feature enables access ports to carry IP voice traffic from an IP phone.
·        When the switch is connected to a Cisco 7960 IP Phone, the phone sends voice traffic with Layer 3 IP precedence and Layer 2 class of service (CoS) values, which are both set to 5 by default.
·        The LAN used for voice traffic from the IP phone is called the voice VLAN and the VLAN used for data is called the data or access VLAN.
·        For the LAN switch to forward traffic correctly, it needs to know the VLAN ID of the voice VLAN as well as the data VLAN.
·         
	PORT CONFIGURATIONS
	 
	PORT TAGGING / 802.1Q
	·        802.1Q tagging is an IEEE standard that allows a networking device to add information to a Layer 2 packet in order to identify the VLAN membership of the packet.
·        Ruckus devices tag a packet by adding a four-byte tag to the packet.
·        The 802.1Q tagging protocol allows the Ethernet frame size to increase by four bytes to a range of 68 to 1522 bytes.
·        This size increase is due to the insertion of a four-byte VLAN tag into the frame.
·        The tags, which include a VLAN Identifier (VID), are attached to each Ethernet frame by MAC address.
·        A port is a 'tagged port' when the interface is expecting frames containing VLAN tags.
·        An example of this is when two switches are connected, and pass tagged traffic.
·        Cisco switches use the term 'trunk' to refer to a tagged port.
	PORT AGGREGATION
	·        link aggregation is the combining of multiple network connections in parallel by any of several methods, in order to increase throughput beyond what a single connection could sustain, to provide redundancy in case one of the links should fail, or both.
·        Examples — In computer networking, link aggregation is the combining (aggregating) of multiple network connections in parallel by any of several methods
	LACP - LINK AGGREGATION CONTROL PROTOCOL
	·        Link Aggregation Control Protocol or LACP is one element of an IEEE specification (802.3ad) that provides guidance on the practice of link aggregation for data connections.
·        Importantly, LACP typically applies to strategies that bundle individual links of Ethernet connections, and not wireless transfers.
·         
	DUPLEX
	·        Many Ethernet connections achieve full-duplex operation by making simultaneous use of two physical twisted pairs inside the same jacket, or two optical fibers which are directly connected to each networked device: one pair or fiber is for receiving packets, while the other is for sending packets.
	SPEED
	·        These LAN (local area network) standards have raised the Ethernet speed limit from 10 megabits per second (Mbps) to 100Mbps for Fast Ethernet and 1000Mbps for Gigabit Ethernet with only minimal changes made to the existing cable structure.
·        Ethernet network speeds have evolved significantly over time and typically range from Ethernet (802.11) at 10 Mbps, Fast Ethernet (IEEE 802.3u) at 100 Mbps, Gigabit Ethernet (IEEE 802.3-2008) at 1000 Mbps and 10 Gigabit Ethernet (IEEE 802.3a) at 10 Gbps.
	FLOW CONTROL
	·        Ethernet flow control is a mechanism for temporarily stopping the transmission of data on Ethernet family computer networks.
·        The goal of this mechanism is to avoid packet loss in the presence of network congestion.
·        The first flow control mechanism, the pause frame, was defined by the IEEE 802.3x standard.
·         
	PORT MIRRORING
	·        Port mirroring is an approach to monitoring network traffic that involves forwarding a copy of each packet from one network switch port to another.
·        Port mirroring enables the administrator to keep close track of switch performance by placing a protocol analyzer on the port that's receiving the mirrored data.
·         
	PORT SECURITY
	·        Port security lets the system administrator define the maximum number of allowed MAC addresses on an interface.
·        These addresses can either learn dynamically or can be set statically.
·        By default, the allowed MAC address for an interface is 1 and MAC addresses are learned dynamically.
·         
	JUMBO FRAMES
	·        jumbo frames are Ethernet frames with more than 1500 bytes of payload, the limit set by the IEEE 802.3 standard.
·        Commonly, jumbo frames can carry up to 9000 bytes of payload, but smaller and larger variations exist and some care must be taken using the term.
·        Baby giant or baby jumbo frames are Ethernet frames that are only slightly larger than allowed by the IEEE Ethernet standards.
·        Baby giant frames are, for example, required for IP/MPLS over Ethernet to deliver Ethernet services with standard 1500-byte payloads.
·        A jumbo frame is an Ethernet frame with a payload greater than the standard maximum transmission unit (MTU) of 1,500 bytes.
·        Jumbo frames are used on local area networks that support at least 1 Gbps and can be as large as 9,000 bytes.
	MDIX – AUTO MEDIUM DEPENDENT INTERFACE CROSSOVER
	·        MDI/MDIX (medium-dependent interface/MDI crossover) is a type of Ethernet port connection that uses twisted-pair cabling to link two networked devices.
·        MDI is part of the media attachment unit that provides the physical and electrical connection to the cabling medium when linking two endpoint devices.
·        Auto-MDIX configures the cable connection automatically, allowing both crossover and straight-through cabling to be used.
·        When the Auto-MDIX interface is connected, it will correct any improper cabling.
·        To ensure the speed is correct, the duplex setting needs to be set to "auto.” MDI Crossover, MDI-X.
	MAC – MEDIA ACCESS CONTROL TABLE
	·        The MAC address table is a way to map each port to a MAC address.
·        This makes it efficient to forward traffic directly to a host.
·        Without the MAC address table, traffic would be forwarded out each port, like a hub (hopefully you haven't used one of those in a long time.)
·        While there are a lot of similarities between these two tables, they serve different purposes.
·        Most importantly, MAC and ARP tables work on different OSI model layers.
·        ARP tables map a Layer 3 address to a Layer 2 address configuration, while MAC tables map a Layer 2 address to a Layer 1 (physical layer) interface.
	POE – POWER OVER ETHERNET
	·        Power over Ethernet (PoE) is a technology for implementing wired Ethernet local area networks (LANs) that enables the electrical current necessary for operating each device to be carried by Ethernet data cables instead of standard electrical power cords and wiring.

·         
	POE+ - POWER OVER ETHERNET PLUS
	·        Power over Ethernet (PoE) is technology that passes electric power over twisted-pair Ethernet cable to powered devices (PD), such as wireless access points, IP cameras, and VoIP phones in addition to the data that cable usually carries.
·        difference between PoE and PoE+ is the actual Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) standards themselves.
·        PoE is 802.3af, while PoE+ is 802.3at. Currently, the max amount of power provided over Cat5 cabling is 15.4 watts for PoE and 25.5 watts for PoE+.
·        PoE Standard – IP Cameras, VOIP Telephones, Wireless Access Points (With two antennas), Switches, Powered Audio.
·        PoE Plus – IP Telephones, Alarm Systems, PTZ Cameras, Motion Tracking Cameras, Remote Computer Terminals, Biometric Sensors.
·         
	STP – SPANNING TREE PROTOCOL
	·        Spanning Tree Protocol (STP) is a Layer 2 network protocol used to prevent looping within a network topology.
·        STP was created to avoid the problems that arise when computers exchange data on a local area network (LAN) that contains redundant paths.
·        Spanning Tree Protocol (STP) is a link management protocol that provides path redundancy while preventing undesirable loops in the network.
·        When it comes to ethernet networks, only one active path can exist between two stations in order for them to function properly.
·        Loops occur in networks for a variety of reasons.
·        Switches with Spanning Tree Protocol implementation in a local area network (LAN).
·        One switch is the STP root bridge.
·        All switch ports that connect a link between two switches are either a root port (RP), a designated port (DP), or a blocked port (BP)
·        Protocol            Standard           Convergence
·        STP         802.1D              Slow
·        PVST+ Cisco  Slow
·        RSTP   802.1w             Fast
·        Rapid PVST+ Cisco  Fast
	CSMA / CD – CARRIER SENSE MULTIPLE ACCESS COLLISION WITH DETECTION 
	·        Carrier-sense multiple access with collision detection (CSMA/CD) is a media access control (MAC) method used most notably in early Ethernet technology for local area networking.
·        It uses carrier-sensing to defer transmissions until no other stations are transmitting.
·        CSMA/CD (Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Detection) helps hosts to decide when to send packets on a shared network segment and how to detect collisions if they occur.
·        For example, in a hub network, two devices can send packets at the same time. This can cause a collision.

	·        The standard supports communications between computers, broadband routers and other devices.
·        802.11g and 802.11b both operate in the widely used 2.4 GHz range, which may lead to interference issues.
·        Bluetooth devices, microwaves and cordless telephones also operate in this range.
·         
	N – WIFI 4
	·        802.11n (Wi-Fi 4)
·        IEEE 802.11n-2009 or 802.11n is a wireless-networking standard that uses multiple antennas to increase data rates.
·        The Wi-Fi Alliance has also retroactively labelled the technology for the standard as Wi-Fi 4.
·        The first standard to specify MIMO, 802.11n was approved in October 2009 and allows for usage in two frequencies - 2.4GHz and 5GHz, with speeds up to 600Mbps.
·        When you hear wireless LAN vendors use the term “dual-band”, it refers to being able to deliver data across these two frequencies.
·         
	AC – WIFI 5
	·        802.11ac (Wi-Fi 5)
·        802.11ac offers backward compatibility to 802.11a/b/g/n and bandwidth rated up to 1300 Mbps on the 5 GHz band plus up to 450 Mbps on 2.4 GHz.

·        802.11ac (aka 5G Wi-Fi) is the next step after 802.11n (aka N or Wireless-N, which is currently is the most popular Wi-Fi standard).
·        It's backward-compatible with N, meaning that a 5G Wi-Fi router will support N clients and 5G Wi-Fi clients will also be able to connect to an N router.
	AX – WIFI6
	·        IEEE 802.11ax, officially marketed by the Wi-Fi Alliance as Wi-Fi 6 (2.4 GHz and 5 GHz) and Wi-Fi 6E (6 GHz), is an IEEE standard for wireless local-area networks (WLANs) and the successor of 802.11ac.

·        Wi-Fi 6 (also known as 802.11ax) is the new generation of Wi-Fi technology with a new focus on efficiency and performance.
·        Wi-Fi 6 technology is all about better and more efficient use of the existing radio frequency medium.
	FREQUENCIES AND RANGE
	·        (The higher the frequency, the faster the data transmission and shorter the signal range.)
·        WiFi frequency bands are frequency ranges within the wireless spectrum that are designated to carry WiFi: 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz.
·        Frequency bands are ranges of radio wave frequencies used to transmit data in the wireless spectrum, and can further be broken down into WiFi channels.
·        (The higher the frequency, the faster the data transmission and shorter the signal range.)
	2.4 GHZ
	·        The 2.4 GHz frequency of the wifi router offers the wifi user a wide coverage area and is better at penetrating solid objects with a maximum speed of 150 Mbps.
·        On the other hand, it has a lower data range and is highly prone to interference and disturbance.
·        A lot of electronic devices and appliances use the 2.4 GHz frequency, including microwaves, baby monitors, and garage door openers.
·        The 2.4GHz band uses longer waves, which makes it better suited for longer ranges or transmission through walls and other solid objects.
·        Ideally, you should use the 2.4GHz band to connect devices for low bandwidth activities like browsing the Internet.
	5GHZ
	·        The 5 GHz band provides less coverage but transmits data at faster speeds.
·        The 6 GHz band, introduced with the new WiFi 6E standard, provides the least coverage but transmits data at the fastest speeds of the three frequencies.
·        The 5 GHz frequency facilitates the customer with a higher data range with negligible interference and offers a great deal when it comes to the internet speeds for wifi for home.
·        Contrary to this benefit, it has a narrow coverage area and is not a successful band when it comes to penetrating solid objects.
·        5 GHz networks do not penetrate solid objects such as walls nearly as well as do 2.4 GHz signals.
·        This can limit an access points reach inside buildings like homes and offices where many walls may come between a wireless antenna and the user.
·         
	CHANNELS
	·        A channel is a passageway, a means of access for a thing, a communication, or an idea. Think of a channel as sort of a tunnel or a funnel that moves something directly through. The noun channel can be used for many such avenues. A WiFi channel is the medium through which our wireless networks can send and receive data.
·        For routers made in the U.S., the 2.4 GHz band has 11 channels and the 5 GHz band has 45 channels.
·        Channels
·        2.4GHz Band. In the 2.4GHz band with a channel width of 20MHz, there are 14 defined channels spaced every 5MHz. ...
·        5GHz Band. In the 5GHz band, there are many possible channels. ...
·        About DFS Channels. In some regions, DFS (Dynamic Frequency Selection) channels operate in the 5GHz band. ...
·        AP Channel Selection.
·        For example, in the 2.4 GHz band, adjacent channels such as channel 3 and 4 have frequencies that closely overlap, which can cause interference.
·        In the 2.4 GHz band, channels 1, 6, and 11 are the most commonly used channels.
·        They do not overlap each other because of the space between their frequencies.
·        Essentially, WiFi channels are smaller bands within WiFi frequency bands that are used by your wireless network to send and receive data.
·        Depending on which frequency band your router is using, you have a certain number of WiFi channels to choose from: 11 WiFi channels are in the 2.4 GHz frequency band.
	REGULATORY IMPACTS
	·        A regulatory domain profile provides configurations of country code, calibration channel, and calibration bandwidth for an AP.
·        A country code identifies the country to which AP radios belong.
·        Different countries support different AP radio attributes, including the transmit power and supported channels.
	CHANNEL BONDING
	·        Channel bonding is a practice commonly used in IEEE 802.11 implementations in which two adjacent channels within a given frequency band are combined to increase throughput between two or more wireless devices.
·        Channel bonding is also known as Ethernet bonding, but it is used heavily in Wi-Fi implementations.
·        Channel bonding is when a cable modem combines multiple channels to increase the amount of traffic that it can comfortably support.
·        The best example for how channel bonding works is to look at a highway with heavy traffic.
·        Example #1 : The three non-overlapping 11n wifi channels operating at 2.4 GHz band are combined to provide 54 Mbps speed.
·        This is known as wifi channel bonding due to its operation in wifi network. The figure depicts two 20 MHz channels are combined to form single 40 MHz channel to deliver fast wifi connection.
	SSID – SERVICE SET IDENTIFIER
	·        The Service Set Identifier (SSID) is a 32-character unique identifier attached to the header of packets that are sent over a Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN).
·        The SSID acts as a password when a mobile device tries to connect to the BSS.
·        The SSID differentiates one WLAN from another.
·        A Wi-Fi network's SSID is the technical term for its network name.
·        For example, if you see a sign telling you to join a network with an SSID of “Airport WiFi”, you just need to pull up the list of wireless networks nearby and join the “Airport WiFi” network.
·         
	BASIC SERVICE SET
	·        The Basic Service Set is a term used to describe the collection of Stations which may communicate together within an 802.11 network.
·        The BSS may or may not include AP (Access Point) which provide a connection onto a fixed distribution system such as an Ethernet network.
·        The BSS is the basic building block of an IEEE 802.11 LAN. Each BSS area roughly corresponds to the coverage of a number of stations.
·        A central concept of a BSS is that all stations must 'hear' each other, that is, be within radio or optical range.
	EXTENDED SERVICE SET
	·        An extended service set (ESS) is one or more interconnected basic service sets (BSSs) and their associated LANs.
·        Each BSS consists of a single access point (AP) together with all wireless client devices (stations, also called STAs) creating a local or enterprise 802.11 wireless LAN (WLAN).
·        An Extended Service Set is comprised of a number of IEEE 802.11 BSS (Basic Service Set) and enables limited mobility within the WiFi network.
·        Stations are able to move between BSS within a single ESS yet still remain connected to the fixed network and so continue to receive emails etc.
	ADHOC – INDEPENDENT BASIC SERVICE SET
	·        An Independent Basic Service Set or ad hoc network is the simplest of all IEEE 802.11 networks in that no network infrastructure is required.
·        As such, an IBSS is simply comprised of one or more Stations which communicate directly with each other.
·        A typical example of an ad-hoc network is connecting two or more laptops (or other supported devices) to each other directly without any central access point, either wirelessly or using a cable.
·        When to use an ad-hoc network: If you want to quickly set up a peer-to-peer (P2P) network between two devices.
	ROAMING
	·        Roaming lets you talk, text and go online when you're outside of your wireless provider's coverage area.
·        With roaming, your data can travel on the network of another provider to give you the wireless connectivity you want.
·        Wireless telecommunication roaming services are usually included in mobile/cellphone subscriber service packages for use outside local networking zones.
·        GSM/WLAN roaming services can be supplied in two different scenarios.
·        One is SIM-based roaming and the second is username/password base roaming.
	ANTENA TYPES
	·         
	OMNI
	·        An omnidirectional antenna is a wireless transmitting or receiving antenna that radiates or intercepts radio-frequency (RF) electromagnetic fields equally well in all horizontal directions in a flat, two-dimensional (2D) geometric plane.
·        The most common example is the dish antenna used with satellite internet, satellite television, and space-communications installations.
·        Other examples include the Yagi antenna, quad antenna, billboard antenna, and helical antenna.
	DIRECTIONAL
	·        A directional antenna, modifies or “directs” the signal, towards a very specific location, not only increasing the gain, but also reducing unwanted reception or interference from surrounding Wireless devices.
·        In consumer applications, the most common directional antenna is the dish used with satellite Internet and satellite television installations.
·        Other types of directional antennas, such as the Yagi antenna, quad antenna, billboard antenna, and helical antenna, are used in a variety of applications.
·         
	ENCRYPTION STANDARDS
	·         
	WPA – WIFI PROTECTED ACCESS
	·        Wi-Fi Protected Access, Wi-Fi Protected Access II, and Wi-Fi Protected Access 3 are the three security and security certification programs developed by the Wi-Fi Alliance to secure wireless computer networks.
·        WPA (Wi-Fi Protected Access) is a wireless security protocol released in 2003 to address the growing vulnerabilities of its predecessor, WEP.
·        The WPA Wi-Fi protocol is more secure than WEP, because it uses a 256-bit key for encryption, which is a major upgrade from the 64-bit and 128-bit keys used by the WEP system.
	WPA2 PERSONAL – AES – ADVANCED ENCRYPTION STANDARD
	·        With WPA2-PSK, user can secure their data, transmitted through the wireless channel between a router and other network devices.
·        It is the latest generation of Wi-Fi security where the key is shared between connected devices.
·        WPA2-PSK is also known as WPA2 Personal.
·        The main difference between these security modes is in the authentication stage.
·        WPA2 Enterprise uses IEEE 802.1X, which offers enterprise-grade authentication.
·        WPA2 Personal uses pre-shared keys (PSK) and is designed for home use.
·        However, WPA2 Enterprise is specifically designed for use in organizations.
·        AES — The Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) encryption algorithm a widely supported encryption type for all wireless networks that contain any confidential data.
·        AES in Wi-Fi leverages 802.1X or PSKs to generate per station keys for all devices.
·        AES provides a high level of security like IP Security (IPsec) clients.
	TKIP – TEMPORAL KEY INTEGRITY PROTOCOL
	·        Temporal Key Integrity Protocol is a security protocol used in the IEEE 802.11 wireless networking standard. TKIP was designed by the IEEE 802.11i task group and the Wi-Fi Alliance as an interim solution to replace WEP without requiring the replacement of legacy hardware.
·        TKIP (Temporal Key Integrity Protocol) is an encryption protocol included as part of the IEEE 802.11i standard for wireless LANs (WLANs). It was designed to provide more secure encryption than the notoriously weak Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP), the original WLAN security protocol.
